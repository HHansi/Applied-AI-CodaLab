# Applied AI Competitions: DL - Evaluation Script 

## Submission instructions
The script takes one prediction file as the input. This file must be a JSON file named "submission.json", which is 
formatted as follows.

{"id": 0, "prediction": 1}<br>
{"id": 1, "prediction": 0}<br>
...

A sample file is available [here](https://github.com/HHansi/Applied-AI-CodaLab/blob/master/dl-optimisation/submission.json). 
Also, make sure that the index order in the submission file is the same as the order in the original test data.
