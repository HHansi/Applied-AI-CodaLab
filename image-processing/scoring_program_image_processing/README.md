# Applied AI Competitions: Image Processing - Evaluation Script 

## Submission instructions
The script takes one prediction file as the input. This file must be a JSON file named "submission.json", which is 
formatted as follows.

{"id": 0, "prediction": "dog"}<br>
{"id": 1, "prediction": "cat"}<br>
...

A sample file is available [here](). 
Also, make sure that the index order in the submission file is the same as the order in the original test data.
